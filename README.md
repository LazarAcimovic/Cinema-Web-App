**Project title**: Cinema Web App

Technologies: Frontend was made in Angular and backend with spring boot. For database, I used PostgreSQL.

This is an web app which enables user to add, remove, update, filter, search and sort cinemas with their relevant informations. Some of them are:
-a film which is presented in cinema
-hall which exists in cinema itself
-reservations which are made for films
